Please run python-game-of-life2.py to see the cooler/more fun visuals.



I reccomend trying out the complex functions because they look so cool and pretty!!  
In the command line of the directory type:  

python python-game-of-life2.py --grid-size 64 --interval 500 --pentadec

**Sub in figeight, hertz, pinwheel, or pulsar in the last argument to see other cool visuals!!


In addition you can try the following args to get a different Life object/animation:
toad, 
blinker, 
glider, 
unbounded, 
diehard, 
lightspaceship,

heavyspaceship,
